My objective is to analyze the evolution of the disks of the Milky Way and M31 throughout the merger. In particular, I am trying to determine how the shape and thickness of the disks evolve. The code that I have written thus far plots the disk of the specified galaxy in a rotated coordinate system, in which the z-axis is aligned with the angular momentum vector of the inner disk. This will allow me to visually analyze how the disks warp and thicken.

The key part of this function is rotation of the coordinate system such that z || L. To do this, the code first reads in the file and transforms the coordinates to the center-of-mass frame. Then, the angular momentum is computed as the sum of angular momenta for each particle, here the cross product of position and velocity; the particles all have the same mass, so it can be ignored as it cancels out in the normalization. Then, using a rotation matrix defined in terms of the dot and cross products of z and L, the entire coordinate system is rotated so that z and L are aligned. The resulting array of positions can then be plotted such that the disk lies in the xy-plane.
