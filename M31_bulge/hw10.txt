1. Circular contours are a good fit for the yz plane. For xy, best fit is achieved with ellipses where q = [0.94, 0.76, 0.72, 0.72, 0.77, 0.82]. The profile is circular at the center, most eccentric around 2 kpc, and less eccentric further out. The bulge appears to be prolate. Ellipticity (1 - q) = [0.06, 0.24, 0.28, 0.28, 0.23, 0.18].

2. Mean = [105, 108, 108], sigma = [79.7, 81.4, 81.5]. Dispersion is roughly isotropic. Enclosed mass = 8.72e10 Msun. This is more than 3x the value calculated in homework 5.

As seen in the disk plots, the signature of rotation is asymmetry. This signature is almost entirely absent from the bulge, but there is still a noticable shear in the plots, especially noticeable when blinking between xy and yx. Thus, the bulge is rotating, but only very slightly.
