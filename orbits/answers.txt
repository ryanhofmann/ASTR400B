1. The orbit is perfectly periodic in position and velocity, as expected.

3. Initially, the plots almost overlap. Then, at about 1 Gyr, M33 reaches its pericenter, and this is where the plots diverge drastically. The orbit model produces an eccentric, slow orbit, whereas the simulation data indicate a much shorter, more rapidly decaying orbit.

4. One of the most important pieces missing from the orbit simulation is dispersive processes, including dynamical friction and tidal effects. Without these processes, the orbit of M33 never decays.

5. One way to include the effects of the Milky Way might be to model the system as a restricted three-body problem, assuming that M33 is of negligible mass.
